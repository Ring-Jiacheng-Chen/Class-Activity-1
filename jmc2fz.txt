I have taken intro to embedded and worked with various MSP430 MCUs and other embedded computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I am familiar with python and C++ and have worked with C and Java before.
I am interested in embedded systems and digital signal processing. Outside of the classroom, I like to read and watch fantasy and sci-fi shows. I hope to learn more about embedded systems and learn about the fundamnetals of RTOS.
