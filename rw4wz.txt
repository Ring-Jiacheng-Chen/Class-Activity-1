I have experience with embedded system about 2 years and my major is EE when I was an undergraduate.
I have taken courses on embedded system and done a few projects with my classmates on Arduino.
I am familiar with C, Java, Python.

Actually, I want to remember what I have learned before and improve them to be a skill for my career.
I do hope to study more about embedded system and combine hardware and software perfectly.
