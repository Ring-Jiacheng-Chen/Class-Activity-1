My only background in embedded is the Intro to Embedded (ECE 3430) course last fall. My other courses with programming were CS 1110, CS 2110, CS 2150, and CS 4102.
The programming languages I've used are C, C++, Java, and Python.
My interests include running, hiking, working out, and playing/watching various sports. I expect to get a deeper knowledge of embedded systems and how to apply
it in a business setting.
