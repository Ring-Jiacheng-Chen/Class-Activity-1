Malcolm Miller (mam3ac)
I began programming during my sophmore year of high school in a class that was taught in Java. Later in high school, I had my first experience with embedded systems when using Arduinos to create a safety alert system (similar to UVA's blue light system). At UVA, I continued my education though taking the intro to embedded computing course. Additionally, I learned C, C++, Python, MATLAB and LabVIEW through courses in the CS department. During my internships, I was able to apply my embedded computing knowledge to develop various test systems.
One of my greatest interests is travel. I am always overjoyed to find myself in a place where I have never been before. Additionally, I enjoy spending time outside and playing the piano and cell. My main expectation for this class is to gain experience in developing embedded software and to better understand real time operating systems. Additionally, I hope to use this knowledge to create an exciting project for the course!
