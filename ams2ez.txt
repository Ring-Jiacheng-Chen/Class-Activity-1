I took a undergrad microcomputer systems class which covered basic
computer organization, microprocessor instruction sets and architectures,
assembly language and computer memory and I/O subsystems. For labs we used the
stm3214 discovery board and Keil. I also took an undergrad digital systems
course which introduced me to modeling, simulation, synthesis
and FPGA design using VHDL as well as microprocessor interfacing. Labs and
assignments were done on ModelSim and implemented on the Nexys4 board. Other
programming languages I know are C, C++, Python and MATLAB.
My interests include cyber physical systems and the application of control
theory and models to analyze and identify hazards in cyber physical systems. I
hope this class will give me insight in design obstacles involved in embedded
system hardware and software.
