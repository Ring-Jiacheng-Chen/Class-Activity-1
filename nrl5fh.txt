UVA ID: 
Background in Embedded Systems: N/A - Ocean Engineer/Offshore and Coastal
                                Systems Engineering ==> Civil Engineering PhD
                                NRT-CPS Program
                                Programming Languages: MatLab, Python, JavaScript, HTML5

I hope to learn about how I may use embedded systems to monitor environmental conditions 
within coastal communities to build smart cities. I also hope that I may use the knowledge acquired
in this course to create my own devices that can obtain the information I need for my research.
I don't really have a background in Embedded Systems nor have I taken a course on Computer 
Architecture, C/C++ etc.
