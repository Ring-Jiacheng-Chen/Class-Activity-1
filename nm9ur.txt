background:
    -I have taken the base embedded systems course with Todd Delong
    -Done several projects with "hobby" boards in the past years
    -I have programming experience in C, C++, Python, Java, and some D/Rust
    -I am really interested in robotics and computer vision. I am also very interested in embedded systems because there are so many things that can be done with them. I just want to learn as much as I can about embedded systems and apply them to my personal/academic projects (like capstone, for example)
