I've taken Intro to Embedded systems and have worked on some small arduino and raspberry pi projects.
Programming, I'm most comfortable with MATLAB and python but am familiar with JAVA. Also over the summer I looked at mainly assembly code for my internship.
I'm interested in having the capabilities to design and make cool stuff. I'm expecting from this class to refamiliarize myself with basic embedded concepts as well as learn a lot and hopefully get more comfortable with the different communication protocols.
