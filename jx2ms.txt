Hi, this is Jiaxi Xu, computing ID: jx2ms

I have taken Computer Architecture ,PLC control courses and have done some simple Single chip microcomputer projects when I was a Mechanic Engineering student. 
I take this course to get a better understanding of embedded systems, especially after finishing Computer Architecture course.
