I do not have any experience with embedded systems. I have some experience with Java, Python, and Matlab.

I am interested in this course because some parts of my research require programming microcontrollers and would like to take a course to help me in that regards. From this course, I would like to learn 
how to program microcontrollers and learn about the high and low levels of embedded systems.
