Reinaldo Christian Reinaldo - rcr9gn

I took a microcontrollers class as an undergraduate, but I have not taken an
embedded systems class before. When it comes to microcontrollers, I have stuck
with arduino, and I have mostly programmed using c and python.

As a student, I enjoy learning control theory and digital signal processing. On
my free time, I enjoy learning different forms of martial arts.
