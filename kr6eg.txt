My background in Embedded Systems programming has come from ECE3430 here at U.Va. I've taken the ECE Comp Arch class & DLD here too. I also got even more experience through the embedded energy harvesting project I worked on (Bluetooth Low Energy Glucose monitor) through my summer internship. I've also actually designed my own preemptive scheduler for the MSP430G2553 and have gone back to make the old code I wrote on the board better in some way. I've used C, C++, Keil uVision, Code Composer, and some proprietary IDEs shipped with some of these BLE microcontrollers.
I'm interested in energy harvesting applications and self-powered systems, and designing fast AND minimal software stacks for the microcontrollers used in them. I like the fact that the Arduino environment is so simple for newbies to get into, plus its object-oriented nature. The problem is, I've looked inside the repositories and there are some questionable things in there, such as using multiplies on hardware without multiplication support in hardware. There's plenty of low-hanging fruit for optimization in those places without sacrificing readability and simplicity.
