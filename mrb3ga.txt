In this course, we used an MSP430 launchpad and programmed using C.Some of my interests include web app development, digital logic design, and computer architecture. In this course, I hope to build upon my knowledge of embedded systems design and programming. I am hoping to derive takeaways from this course that will be helpful with the capstone project I am working on this semester.
