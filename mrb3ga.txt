My previous background in embedded systems design and programming is basically limited to the introduction to embedded course (ECE 3430). In this course, we used an MSP430 launchpad and programmed using C.

Some of my interests include web app development, digital logic design, and computer architecture. In this course, I hope to build upon my knowledge of embedded systems design and programming. I am hoping to derive takeaways from this course that will be helpful with the capstone project I am working on this semester.
