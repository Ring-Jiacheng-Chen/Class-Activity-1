Prior relevant coursework consists of Introduction to Embedded Systems and CS 2150. Over the summer, part of my project
for my lab consisted of implementing USART based SPI on an Atmel SAM3X8E.

My interests include low level programming, information security, and software engineering. In this class, I expect to 
significantly increase my proficiency in embedded programming, as well as learning the fundamentals of operating
systems. Following the conclusion of the course, I am thinking about implementing an RTOS on another microcontroller,
such as the Atmel SAM3X8E I previously worked on.
