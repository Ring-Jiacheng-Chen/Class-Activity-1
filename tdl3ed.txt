Tyler Labiak, tdl3ed
I am a third year electrical engineer. I took intro to embedded systems last semester, so I'm very familiar with the MSP 430 launchpad, and I have previously taken CS 2110 and DLD. I have experience in embedded C, Java, python and R.
I really like skiing and surfing, and the super smash bros series. As a student I'm interested in the more mathematical aspects of ECE like signal processing, although I haven't gotten to explore those classes as much yet! I also have the engineering business minor and I'm a member of two McIntire clubs- I find economics and finance pretty interesting, and I'm considering a career in consulting. That being said I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the intro embedded class, since I wouldn't really consider myself a software guy. For that reason, I hope that this class picks up where the intro course left off, and we can go a little deeper with some of the topics we brushed over in there.
