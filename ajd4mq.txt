I have experience with arduino as well as AVR microcontroller programming with Atmel Studio 7.  I have
also worked with ESP8266 (micropython) and some msp430.  I can do some DSP programming and have done
I2C, UART, and SPI.  I have taken intro to embedded.  I have done coding in C,C++, assembly, and micropython.

I am interested in using embedded stuff for implementing DSP algorithms and also implementing communications protocols
like I2C, bluetooth, or even internet protocols.  I expect to have good experience and knowledge of arm processors and 
real-time OS's after this class.
