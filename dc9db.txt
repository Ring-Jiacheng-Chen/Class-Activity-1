I don't have much background in Embedded Systems Design. My experience is mostly CS Computer Architechture from Undergraduate, and Digital Logic Design in the ECE department from my undergraduate. I haven't done any projects in Embedded, maybe closest thing would be the final HW in Digital Logic Design where we create a simple sequential processor using Logisim. I've done alot of programming, but I mainly program with Java or Python.
After Taking Digital Logic Design, I've always been interested in hardware and embedded systems, but didn't get to take any courses in the field as I didnt' have priority in course enrollment due to being a BACS major (College of Arts and Science) I expect to learn more on using hardware, and hope I can get more ideas on using hardware such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
