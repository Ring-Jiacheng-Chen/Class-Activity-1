I have taken Introduction to Embedded Systems with 
Todd DeLong and am now TAing the class for the 3rd
semester in a row. I have done a few small self 
projects with Arduino and competed in Robotics in 
High School. I also worked an internship this past
summer coding for embedded systems in C and Python.

I am interested in the full development and design
process of embedded systems, including putting
together hardware and writing software. I hope to
learn more about the full development process in
this class, as well as best practices and ways for 
optimizations.
