Intro to embedded, computer architecture, FPGA, ASIC/SOC Design, Intro to VLSI. I have worked in C, C++, C#, Python.
My interests are in embedded systems and programming on them. I want to learn more about embedded systems and how I can use them in other projects. I also want to understand the difference between the many options out there on the market and take advantage of each of them.
